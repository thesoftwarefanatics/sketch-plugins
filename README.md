# TSF Sketchplugins

We currently use our sketch plugins to improve and automate our work process in the design team. Those plugins are currently hard coded and do match our current internal requirements.

You can download the latest version of the plugin [here](https://github.com/thesoftwarefanatics/sketch-plugins/releases/latest)

## What you can do?

- Fix Elements to match to the 3px or 6px grid (size and position)
- Select elements which don't fit to the 3px or 6px grid (size and position)
- Set the grid (6px) or subgrid (3px) for your artboards

#### Want to be part of our team?
We are always looking for motivated and inspired people not only in the design team.
